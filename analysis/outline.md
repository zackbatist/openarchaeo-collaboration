## Intro

* There is open archaeology
* Open archaeology is related to open source
* Is open archaeology open source, and is open source open?
  * [Is 'open archaeology' just uploading CSVs?]

## Background

* What is open source?
* Summary of key publications in open archaeology / DIY archaeology
* But is any of this real? There seems to be a lack of reflection about what open archaeology is.

## Data and methodology

* open-archaeo
* GitHub API
* Indicate how much is on GitHub or elsewhere

## What is open archaeology?

Figures: ?

- Breakdown of tags and categories
- Breakdown of platforms and languages
- Tags by category
- Licenses?

## Twenty years of open archaeology

Figures: ?

- Growth of open archaeology by number of commits
- Growth of open archaeology by number of repos
- Compare changing proportions of each category on a year by year basis
- Identify periods associated with different rates of growth, and relate these with different general attitudes in the history of digital archaeology

## Projects with a pulse?

Project pulse (or another term to denote measurement and analysis of activity, which is more inclusive of factors other than temporal distribution)

Figures:

- Charts presenting commit rates and repo longevity
- Charts presenting the number of contributors and the amount of work that they each contributed
- Charts presenting the use of issues and comments

## An emerging network of open archaeologists?

Figures: ?

* Are there significant networks? If so, how big and how many?
  * Only one, it seems!

### [Repo-repo] What forms this network?

* Identify the repos/organisations that are the focus of the most intense collaboration?
  * Are they thematically or topically linked?
  * Do they map onto real-world research centres?
* Is the network a new thing, or just a translation of existing offline networks (e.g. fields, institutions) onto GitHub?
  * cf. is open source really open?

### [User-user] Who forms this network?

* What proportion of users and repos are connected to this network?
* What predicts membership in this network?
* Does centrality in the network correlate with general rate of activity?
*  Who are the most central nodes in this network? Is there anything they have in common?
   * High activity?
   * Certain platforms/categories/languages?
* Qualitative analysis of top 50? 100? most connected users
  * Career stage? Precarity? Employer? Location?

## Conclusion

There is an emerging community of practice around open source in archaeology.

But:

* It is limited and fragmented
  * A small set of subfields are represented
  * Probably most people still haven't heard it?
* Collaboration is limited
  * Most work remains solo & short-lived
  * Perhaps because open source norms conflict with academic norms?
* The members of this community face structural challenges in academia

Starting with a relatively simple plot, this is a chart of the cumulative growth of open archaeology over the years, measured by code contributions committed and pushed to GitHub repositories.

As we can see, archaeologists have been using git from even before GitHub was launched in 2008. But they really began to get into it around 2014--2015, when we see an uptick in the rate of growth that has continued ever since.

Around this time we also see that GitHub starts being used to host documents and scripts. This may represent a recognition of GitHub's ability to track things other than code, and a willingness to experiment with version control systems as a medium for disseminating work, especially work or manifestations of undervalued skills that may not necessarily be easily represented using traditional publication venues, in an open and somewhat nerdy way.
